## 🎯 Key Functionality

### Approval System

  // Update painting status to APPROVED
  // Remove from pending list
  // Add approval metadata (date, staff member)
};
```

### Rejection System

  const matchesStatus = /* page-specific status */;
  return matchesSearch && matchesCategory && matchesStatus;
});
```

## 🚀 Integration with Backend

Currently implemented with local state management. To integrate with backend:

### 1. API Endpoints Needed:

```
GET    /api/paintings?status=PENDING      → Get pending paintings
GET    /api/paintings?status=APPROVED     → Get approved paintings
GET    /api/paintings?status=REJECTED     → Get rejected paintings
PATCH  /api/paintings/:id/approve         → Approve painting
PATCH  /api/paintings/:id/reject          → Reject painting (with reason)
```

### 2. Update Handlers:

```typescript
const handleApprove = async (paintingId: string) => {
  try {
    await fetch(`/api/paintings/${paintingId}/approve`, {
      method: "PATCH",
    });
    // Update local state or refetch
  } catch (error) {
    // Show error toast
  }
};

const handleReject = async (paintingId: string, reason: string) => {
  try {
    await fetch(`/api/paintings/${paintingId}/reject`, {
      method: "PATCH",
      body: JSON.stringify({ reason }),
    });
    // Update local state or refetch
  } catch (error) {
    // Show error toast
  }
};
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Single column grid, stacked filters
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Two column grid
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Three column grid
- **All modals**: Responsive with proper padding and scrolling

## 🎨 Sample Data Included

Each page includes realistic sample data:

- **Pending**: 5 sample paintings awaiting review
- **Approved**: 5 sample approved paintings
- **Rejected**: 4 sample rejected paintings with various rejection reasons

## ✅ Navigation Integration

The sidebar has been updated to include these routes under "Competitor Management":

- All Competitors
- Search & Filter

## 🔒 Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

1. Bulk actions (approve/reject multiple)
2. Export paintings list to CSV/PDF
3. Email notifications to competitors
4. Image preview/zoom functionality
5. Painting history/audit log
